# Course Project: Analysis of Synteny and Conservation of Metabolic Pathways in Photosynthetic Organisms

## General Description

This project, developed during the Bioinformatics II course, at Peruvian University Cayetano Heredia, explores the synteny and conservation of metabolic pathways in four representative photosynthetic species: a unicellular alga (*Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*), a model plant (*Arabidopsis thaliana*), a parasitic plant (*Cuscuta australis*), and a carnivorous plant (*Roridula gorgonias*). The main objective was to identify conserved orthologous genes and syntenic blocks among these species to better understand how key metabolic pathways have been maintained throughout evolution.

## Main Results

1. **Genomic Assembly Quality**:
   - The genomes of *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* showed higher continuity and quality, whereas *Roridula gorgonias* presented a fragmented assembly due to limitations in the available data.

2. **Evolutionary Relationship**:
   - Few orthologous genes were shared between *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* and the other species, reflecting its evolutionary divergence (~725 million years ago).
   - *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Cuscuta australis*, and *Roridula gorgonias* shared a significant number of orthologous genes, especially between the first two.

3. **Syntenic Block Conservation**:
   - No syntenic blocks were found between *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* and terrestrial plants.
   - The most relevant syntenic blocks were identified between *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Cuscuta australis*. These blocks are enriched in genes associated with:
     - Intracellular regulation (kinase activity).
     - Cell cycle (replication, cytokinesis).
     - Ion transport.
     - Embryonic development and adaptation to abiotic and biotic stress.

4. **Genomic Reduction**:
   - *Cuscuta australis* and *Roridula gorgonias* exhibited smaller genomes, with a loss of genes associated with photosynthesis, reflecting their adaptations as a parasitic and carnivorous plant, respectively.

5. **GO Term Enrichment**:
   - A general analysis of GO term counts across the genome was performed, focusing on key pathways such as photosynthesis. The results showed that *Arabidopsis thaliana* has the highest number of genes associated with most GO terms, except for the GO term related to cilia-dependent cell motility, which is unique to *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*. This highlights the role of *Chlamydomonas* as a unicellular, aquatic organism with distinct adaptations.
   - The parasitic plant *Cuscuta australis* exhibited a notable reduction in genes involved in photosynthesis and related processes (e.g., nitrate import and dark photosynthetic reactions), consistent with its loss of autotrophy. Similarly, *Roridula gorgonias* showed similar reductions, reflecting its carnivorous lifestyle and reliance on alternative nutrient sources.
   - In syntenic blocks, GO terms enriched between *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Cuscuta australis* included genes critical for cell cycle regulation, ion transport, and stress response, indicating conserved pathways vital for terrestrial adaptation.
